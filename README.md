# simon-memory-game

This is a simple memory game from one of the exercises in Dr Angela Yu's Web Development Course 2023.
The game is built using simple jQuery, HTML and CSS. 
I modified the features a little bit to add a play button instead of requiring the player to press any key to start or restart.
Also, I added the mobile responsiveness portion so that it reads better on a mobile screen.

The rules of the game is simple. 
The computer will randomly select the first color button. 
The player will press the same color button. 
The computer will randomly select the second color button. 
The player now has to recall and press the first color button and then the second button. 
Each time the player presses the buttons in the correct sequence, player levels up and the sequence gets longer.
It is game over when the player breaks the sequence and presses the wrong button.
The game restarts.
